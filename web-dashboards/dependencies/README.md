# Dependencies Dashboard

The dependencias dashboard shows a network graph with the dependencies between
items in CROSSMINER projects.

In the current version it shows the dependencies between the bundles of a Java
projects. The data with the dependencies is generated by CWI partner. If you want to test all, just ask for them because they are not public yet.

## Install

And the [GrimoireLab python env must be active](/web-dashboards#install-grimoirelab-python-env)

Now the tool can be executed with:

```
