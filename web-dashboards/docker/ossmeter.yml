# Docker Composer File to launch the OSSMETER-Platform as a distributed application
#
# The application is composed by 4 services:
#   - oss-web: corresponds to the service of OSSMETER platform website
#   - oss-app: service running api server and the orchestrator of OSSMETER slave instances
#   - oss-slave: service corresponding to the OSSMETER slaves responsible for the analysis
#    of software projects
#   - oss-db: service responsible for the the storage of OSSMETER data
#
#
version: "2"
services:
    oss-web: #deploys the OSSMETER Web App
        image: crossminer/ossmeter-web  # directory to the corresponding Dockerfile
        depends_on:
            - oss-app
            - oss-db #only requests for oss-db service to be launched before this service. DB may still not be ready when this service starts
        networks:
            - default

        # maps the port 9000 in the localhost to port 9000 of container  "HOST:CONTAINER"
        ports:
            - "9000:9000"

    oss-app: #Deploys a container with the OSSMETER platform configured to act as master
             # and to run the api server used by oss-web service
        image: crossminer/ossmeter-platform
        entrypoint: ./eclipse -apiServer -master -ossmeterConfig prop.properties
#        entrypoint: ./eclipse -apiServer -master -slave -ossmeterConfig prop.properties
        depends_on:
            - oss-db
        networks:
            - default
        expose: #exposes OSSMETER API client port to oss-web application
            - 8182
            - 8183 #Admin API?

    oss-slave: # Service containing OSSMETER slaves instances
        image: crossminer/ossmeter-platform
        entrypoint: ./eclipse -slave -ossmeterConfig prop.properties
        depends_on:
            - oss-db

        networks:
            - default
 # NOTE: To scale up the number of slaves in OSSMETER application using docker composer use:
 #                  docker-compose scale oss-slave=X
 #       where 'X' corresponds to the total number of slaves wanted in the application
 #
 # Each slave instance consumes a great amount of processing and memory resources.
 # Deployment of multiple instances may harm the system performance

    oss-db: # data storage service
        image: mongo:3.4 #current setup uses mongodb
        networks:
            - default
        expose:  #exposes database port to oss-web and oss-app
            - 27017
        volumes: #creates volume on container
            - ~/oss-data:/data/db
 # Uncomment the port map below to give access to external mongo database visualizers
        ports:
            - "27017:27017"
 #   Current database setup consists in a single db instance. May be changed to a
 # replication deployment to increase fault tolerance and to better handle  the number of
 # read and write operations
